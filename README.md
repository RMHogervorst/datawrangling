Data munging/ Wrangling / Rectanguling your data.

I gave this short talk to my coworkers of the [Methodology and Statistics department of Psychology - Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/social-behavioural-sciences/psychology/methodology-and-statistics).


# Abstract:
In statistics education we focus on basic statistics, probability
and models. However, our students (and many of us as well)
have a hard time getting
their data in their statistical program, reshaping or cleaning it.
This is an introduction to the tidyverse and some examples of data 
manipulation that could be trivial, but are often not that simple.
Modern tools in R "the Tidyverse" is build around the same philosophy
of rectangular data and consistent tools that work in the same way.
