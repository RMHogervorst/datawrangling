Data munging/ Wrangling / Rectanguling your data.

I gave this short talk to my coworkers of the [Methodology and Statistics department of Psychology - Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/social-behavioural-sciences/psychology/methodology-and-statistics).


# Abstract:
In statistics education we focus on basic statistics, probability
and models. However, our students (and many of us as well)
have a hard time getting
their data in their statistical program, reshaping or cleaning it.
Modern tools in R (known as "the Tidyverse") are build around the 
philosophy of 'tidy' data and consist of rectangular data and 
tooling (packages) that all work in the same way. This is an
introduction  to the "tidyverse"" and I have some examples of data 
manipulation that should be trivial, but is often not.

keywords: tidy data, tidyverse,
